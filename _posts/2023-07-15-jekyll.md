TLDR; Jekyll is cool as I get to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript, while building a portfolio. Killing two birds with one stone, eh. _Menyelam sambil minum air._

The long story of how this came about:

### Existential Crisis and Job Hunting

In one of my bouts of doubt and panic resignation as I found myself unable to face the reality of corporate work, I decided I need to look for a new job, one that allows me to work in a small team, like a startup. I digged through Hiredly, which I instantly loved mainly because of its cool and simple UI.

I had a tiny problem, though. I was cluesless about where I want my career path to lead. I know what I don't want - unfortunately, that which directly relates to my degree. I know what I like - Art and Mathematics (and coding). Software developer is the best match.

So I've outlined my plan towards this new career goal:
1. Build a portfolio
2. Learn a niche skill
3. Learn a new language
4. Start small projects

On to number one, to build a portfolio.

### Blogging on Jekyll 

I really have nothing to showcase, yet. But why a portfolio first? 

What prompted me was a job ad for a Rendering Engineer, which seems niche and therefore cool. I don't have all of the skills, but that didn't stop me from applying, what stopped me was: *Link to a website/blog/portfolio: _
I couldn't proceed without it.

Come to think of it, it makes sense to start with this as I can't prove my skills with professional experience. Building a portfolio is a nice little project to hyperfocus on, plus I get to learn new skills if I build it from scratch.

Building from scratch with Jekyll, done. But scratch that, it didn't work out. What you're seeing now is built from a forked GitHub theme. More stories on that later.

So long and noodnight.
